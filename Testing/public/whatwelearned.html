                        <p>"I really enjoyed the collaborative environment and the challenge of bringing an idea to life through teamwork. My role focused on creating diagrams, program mockups, and designing the front end for both the landing page and the survey page, which helped me improve my design thinking and front-end development skills. One area for improvement would be dedicating more time to user testing and feedback. If we had more time, I would have loved to refine the UI further and implement more advanced personalization features to enhance user recommendations."</p>

                        <p>"I went into this project with limited knowledge of Javascript, but it turned out to be a lot of fun learning and figuring out how to put a larger project together. If I had more time I would like to clean up the code and make the site more flexible for larger amounts of users, but I've learned its particularly important to avoid scope creep with such a relatively short time for development."</p>

                        <p>"After establishing our idea, each member took the initiative and positioned themselves into the roles that best matched their strengths, which was deemed easy with how diverse each of our backgrounds were. This group was astounding at prioritizing communication and teamwork. With my background in HTML and Photoshop skills, I was responsible for the completion of our capstone poster and webpage. I learned a lot from this project, not only deeper into HTML commands and layouts, but also a better flow of wording things through collaboration sessions. I believe that if a time extension was granted to our project, we would have gone further into improving the UI on the front-end, along with the creation of a demonstration tutorial video. Overall, I am very pleased with our final product and happy to be a member of this group and was the textbook definition of how a group should operate."</p>

                        <p>"This project was an excellent opportunity for everybody to showcase our software development skills and create an application that provides value to citizens of the world. We all at some point had to step out of our comfort zone and do things that we are required and are not familiar with. 
                            It was a great learning process for us in the many aspects of a software project. I really enjoyed communicating with my teammates, seeing where they are, and providing a helping hand when needed. It was fruitful to see a concept turning into a software product, although we had to be patient and be problem-solvers. 
                            One thing that could be improved, would be to reduce duplicated code in our html - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" target="blank">DRY (don't repeat yourself)</a> principle can improve software reusability, readability, and maintanability.

                        <p>"What I ended up really enjoying about this project was whenever I'd start working on designing a part of it, I would end up having fun to the point where I'd be driven to find more to do. Even if something I wanted to do was something I didn't know how to do, I'd immediately just look up how to make things work because at times, it almost felt like I was learning a game. The biggest spot I have for improvement would definitely be cleaning up how messy the code I wrote became as a result; that's something I'd definitely want to improve upon with time."</p>
